# doctor-visits
A health app for logging doctor visits.

## Technologies used: Bootstrap CSS, HTML, Express, EJS, MangoDB, Mongoose, Heroku

- I used bootstrap to style the buttons on each page.

----

## Sources:

- For the delete button modal, I used jQuery submit method here: `https://api.jquery.com/submit/`

- For the gender selection, I used a radio button selection here:
 `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28543752/multiple-radio-button-groups-in-one-form`

 - For the shadow on the buttons, I got it from here: `https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/`. Since hovering does not work on mobile, I took out the hover effect, thus it only shows a shadow under the buttons.

## Difficulties:

- Instead of using `localhost:3000/"name here"`, I miscalculated when planning my pages out. I ended up using localhost:3000 as my `main/landing page` before the user can navigate to the other pages.

- I had to keep adding more ejs pages as the actual scope of work was more than I had initially planned out in the wireframe.

- Had trouble grabbing the information for an object that's inside of an array for the `visit summary`.
    - Instead of creating a second schema for a patient's visits and associating them, I ended up using the index for each visit's document when updating. 
    - Struggle: I couldn't figure out how to delete a visit based on the index

- Couldn't get the shadow effect working for my input buttons so I had to change it to a button.

## Biggest Struggle:

## Wireframe (initial): 

- `Main/index.ejs page`, include a Log Today's Visit button at the top.

`Create page`:
- Log Today's Visit button gives you the option of creating a new patient or go to an existing patient.
    - Existing patient will already have patient information and previous visits.
    - Create a new patient will load a new patient form into the `new.ejs`.

- Information will then be displayed on the `show.ejs` page with the option to `update` or `delete` information.

## Wireframe (new):

What I did not expect was the additional functionality I needed to include such as:

 - After submitting the info for a new patient, it will go to a page for adding new visits in `visitnew.ejs`. 
 - Then the information will display in the `show.ejs` page.
 - I also included an option for the user to be able to update a specific visit entry which will route to `visitedit.ejs`.
 - And the option to `add a new visit entry`.
