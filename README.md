# doctor-visits
A health app for logging doctor visits

## Technologies used: Bootstrap CSS, HTML, Express, EJS, MangoDB, Mongoose, Heroku

- I used bootstrap to style the buttons on each page.

## Difficulties:

- Instead of using localhost:3000/"name here", I messed up with the planning, so I used localhost:3000 as my main/landing page before the user can navigate to the other pages.
